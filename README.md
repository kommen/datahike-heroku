# datahike-heroku

A clj-template for a web app running on Heroku using datahike with postgres.

## Heroku App Setup

Ensure your newly generated app is backed with a git repo and commit the
initial verison.

Create a heroku app and a postgres database for it (hobby dev is free)

```

```

Make heroku use the latest Clojure CLI version

```
heroku config:set CLOJURE_CLI_VERSION=1.10.1.763
```

Deploy 

```
git push heroku main
```

This will print the URL of you're newly created app at the end.
